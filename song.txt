This is getting heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (whoo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire, and set the night alight (hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa-oh-oh
